From MIT, (http://newsoffice.mit.edu/1994/safe-0105)
"The single exposure limit for a child is 300 millirems (whole body equivalent) and the annual total exposure cannot exceed 500 millirems."
1000 millirem = 1 rem,
300 millirem = 0.3 rem

0.3 Rem per year [rem/y]

=   342.231 348 391 5 Nanosievert per hour [nSv/h]
=   0.342 231 348 4 Microsievert per hour [µSv/h]

COMPARISION
http://www.nea.gov.sg/anti-pollution-radiation-protection/radiation-protection
Radiation level as at 4 PM, 30 Apr 2015 is 0.1 micro-sievert per hour. 

Status: NORMAL

nSv/h = nanosievert


*Serious Note*
I don't think you would be bothered to read a WISP assignment 2 report so your friend's article is most likely this:

why is the url so long

Recent news related to radiation in Japan:

Radiation Comparison (atmospheric):
MIT: Single Exposure limit for a child: 300 millirems, maximum 500 annually. (http://newsoffice.mit.edu/1994/safe-0105)
 The Adult's limit is x10 more than a child but for safety sake, we take the lowest limit (300 millrem)
300 millirem = 0.3 rem / year limit
=   342.231 348 391 5 Nanosievert per hour [nSv/h]
=   0.342 231 348 4 Microsievert per hour [µSv/h]
In Singapore, radiation level was 4 PM, 30 Apr 2015 is 0.1 micro-sievert per hour.
At Hino Tokyo, the average was 0.116 (http://park30.wakwak.com/~weather/geiger_index.html). Other accounts was at about 0.06ish but that is too low for me to believe it.

Radiation (food):
http://www.zdnet.com/article/scientists-say-fukushimas-food-is-safe-so-why-arent-the-japanese-eating-it/
http://www.nature.com/news/fukushima-data-show-rise-and-fall-in-food-radioactivity-1.17016
Food is also another source of radiation but I don't think the radiation from food will really affect tourists (or even locals).

Conclusion: Japan should be safe from a tourist's point of view - you'll probably get more exposure to radiation on the flight to Japan than you would during your stay there. Even if the Japanese govt tweaked the data, it is quite unlikely that a few days of that level of exposure will have much effect on anyone.

The issues that arose in this article (more symptoms etc, worsened conditions of Japanese folk)
http://www.save-children-from-radiation.org/2013/11/11/title-dr-shigeru-mita-addresses-the-need-of-blood-examination-among-children-in-the-kanto-area/
is *probably* due to the radiation level exceeding the exposure limit when the nuclear reactor meltdown occured. I'm not expert but I'm guessing that's what happened.
