Together with 2 other like-minded individuals, Jeremy Lim and Jian Yu, we embarked on TrAVEl as our final year project.<br><br>TrAVEl is an Android application (app) to help the visually impaired and elderly navigate Singapore using public transport. It automatically plans the best route based on the starting and ending points provided. It provides real-time updates even if there are other apps running to ensure the user is kept updated on where he is, when the next bus is arriving and also informs the user when to board/alight the bus/train through notifications. The route is recalculated if the user missed the stop.<br><br>The user experience (UX) is both visually and aurally designed for the visually impaired and works well with Android accessibility features (e.g. Talkback) if necessary. There is also a help button at the same location on every page to guide users if they are disoriented. Testing was done with the visually impaired guides at Dialogue in the Dark (DID) to ensure satisfactory UX.<br><br>A key feature is the speech-to-text recognition of a large dataset of Singapore places such as Jurong East, Bishan or even Bukit Chandu which makes it a lot easier for visually impaired to use (compared to existing apps). The app is also able to recognise speakers with different accents and pronunciations of most Singapore locations.<br><br>The development of TrAVEl has also led to the creation of spinoff apps, such as a bus timing monitor for the Pebble smartwatch which is also visually impaired-friendly, and a bus location viewer which uses live data from users of TrAVEl to display the locations of buses. It has also been covered by The Straits Times and won our team the Ngee Ann Polytechnic Outstanding Innovation Team Award.<br><br>After our final year project, we have worked with Ngee Ann Polytechnic (NP) and DID to refine the application. Since then, the team has handed over the project to NP publish and provide maintenance.<br><br>I am very thankful to NP, my advisors and last but not least my team of friends who made this project a success. It is my wish that the application would be helpful to the visually impaired and elderly community, especially since I have friends and relatives who fall under these categories.<img class='work-content' src='assets/png/travel-team.png' alt='travel team image'><div class='caption'>The TrAVEl team & supervisors.
